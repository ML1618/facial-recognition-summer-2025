# 2025 Summer Programming Project - Facial Recognition

This is a facial recognition software designed to draw a bounding box around visible faces it sees, coded in Python 3.12.10 (due to TensorFlow requiring Python 3.9-3.12). Following along with this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_W4EYtsa10) (currently at 1:23:03).

## Dependencies Used

 - labelme
 - tensorflow-cpu
 - opencv-python
 - matplotlib
 - albumentations

## Libraries imported

 - os
 - time
 - uuid
 - json
 - keras
 - cv2
 - numpy
 - pyplot from matplotlib
 - albumentations
 - tensorflow

## What I Learned

 - Advantages of using a virtual environment (venv/virtualenv)
   - Allows me to install packages within the environment, without modifying the global installation
   - Allows for multiple different codebases with incompatible libraries without them interfering with each other 
 - How to work with large amounts of data

## Roadblocks

 - Tensowflow and opencv-python couldn't be installed with pip
   - Fix: uninstall Python from Microsoft Store and reinstall (same version) from official website, adding python.exe to PATH
 - Couldn't open labelme GUI
   - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79705046/running-labelme-in-vs-code-terminal-gets-importerror-dll-load-failed-while-impo/79723660#79723660
 - Couldn't find the right mix of drivers, cuDNN, CUDA, and TensorFlow-GPU packages
   - Used Tensorflow (v2.19.0) CPU for Windows 11 instead
 - > oneDNN custom operations are on. You may see slightly different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different computation orders. To turn them off, set the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0`.
   - Add `os.environ['TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS'] = '0'` and `os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '2'` at top of files to fix rounding errors and suppress low-level warnings
 - When showing the augmented images in text in `augmented_images_to_tensorflow.py`, all the values are 0
